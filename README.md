Share some love to our buddies rubyists! Say simple **Thank You** to
all, who spent their time for open source software we use!

## The Problem

Surely you've already thought about how important it is sometimes â€“ to say
**Thank You**. How nice it is - get those thanks in your address. Especially if
it's no thanks for what you had to do or have done because it's your
job, but because you have done something as a hobby and this is
something very beneficial to someone else. At the moment I'm talking
about open source software. I know a few sad stories when the people who created the
project, just dropped his hands to maintain it. When the number of
negatives outweighed the number of good reviews. When just do not have
time or do not see that someone needs it. And I believe that if just in our
beautiful community we will share a little more love for each other -
such stories will become a lot rarer! It's so easy - to say **Thank You**
to those who made part of your job. Who spent their free time to
support a project in an efficient condition. Who in the end allows you
by their work to earn money and experience easier. All these
people are certainly getting a lot of good words in his address, but
most of them just appear in the specifications established by the gems
on your computer and even yourself can not be aware of them and their
contribution in your project.

I offer a simple way to say thank you to all those people!

## Instalation

```bash
gem install share_some_love
```

## Usage

For your gem project
```bash
cd your_gem_directory

share_some_love [by_gem]
```

After that you can review and add to your repository file `./LOVE.md`
You can check example files, which I generated for this project with and
without `by_gem` option:
[LOVE_by_gemfile.md](https://github.com/gazay/share_some_love/blob/master/LOVE_by_gem.md)
and
[LOVE_by_author.md](https://github.com/gazay/share_some_love/blob/master/LOVE_by_author.md)

For web projects I don't have styles and javascripts to page looks
pretty, so there only naked html and alert(1) will be generated =)
For your web project:
```bash
cd your_project_directory

share_some_love site [by_gem]
```

After that you can review and add to your repository file `./public/love.html`


*P.s. Don't forget to share your page or file in twitter with hashtag #share_some_love*
