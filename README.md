# Share some love

:heart::green_heart::yellow_heart::blue_heart::purple_heart::sparkling_heart::heart::green_heart::yellow_heart::blue_heart::purple_heart::sparkling_heart::heart::green_heart::yellow_heart::blue_heart::purple_heart::sparkling_heart::heart::green_heart::yellow_heart::blue_heart::purple_heart::sparkling_heart:

Share some love with our buddies rubyists! Say **Thank You** to all kind people, who
spent their time to create and maintain open source software we use!

## The Problem

Have you ever been thinking how important it is to say **Thank You** sometimes?
And what pleasure it is to get kind words back! Especially when something being a
hobby to you appears to be beneficial to somebody else. That's how open-source software
works.

Unfortunately it happens all the time: amount of criticism outweights positive
reviews. And you give up on that. But the project you was working on is awesome!
We just didn't have enough of time or will to see you need our support.

**NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN!**

Let's share a bit more of love! It's really easy to say **Thank You** to incredible
people that just made part of your work. That spent their personal time to maintain something
so useful. That allowed you to learn something new.

And with `share_some_love` it just got even easier.

Here are some sample files that were generated with this gem itself:

  * [LOVE_by_gemfile.md](https://github.com/gazay/share_some_love/blob/master/LOVE_by_gem.md) – with `by gem` option
  * [LOVE_by_author.md](https://github.com/gazay/share_some_love/blob/master/LOVE_by_author.md) – without `by gem` option

I don't currently have styles and JS to make Web Projects love pages look pretty. So here is another chance to share some love: help me with that ;).

**P.S. Don't forget to mention your page or file in twitter using hashtag `#share_some_love`**
